# Notations

- B(X,Y): Bounded linear operator from normed X to normed Y
- C(X,Y): A subset of B(X,Y), compact operators
- c(X,Y):

# Complete set
- A closed subset is complete

# Compact set

# Finite dimension
- Finite dim is closed
- Finite

# Relatively compact
- Relatively compact $\Longrightarrow$ totally bounded
- Totally bounded $\Longrightarrow$ bounded
