- My study group finds Folland's a little difficult to self-study, so chose Stein's as study material for basic differentiation/integration/measure theory.

- Easy to read: an integration is well presented, split in four stages. I find that some other books choose this style of presentation of integration as well.

- Not easy to read: a section is long and hard to get the structure if you don't focus. For example, for differentiation, the book nicely presents two questions about whether a differentiation is integrable and whether an integration is differentiable. However, going through a lot of propositions and properties with some important findings hidden in them, I lost my way to two questions in the beginning.

- Imprecise definitions: There is only one imprecise definition I found in the book. Hilbert space is defined to be separable. However the author is aware that Hilbert space generally does not need to be separable, since some exercise problems explicitly state 'separable Hilbert space'. Maybe it is defined in this way for convinience because most interesting applications are separable cases, but the issue is the book does not make it explicit, and hence all propositions in this book involving Hilbert space may represent 'separable Hilbert spaces' or sometimes general Hilbert spaces.

- challenging problems: in constrast to that Stein's is known for being easier than Folland's, there are a lot of problems and they are all difficult.
