# 4. Hilbert Spaces

Many theorems in Ch4 are included in the general properties of Hilbert spaces, and omitted here. Refer to Kreyszig's <Functional Analysis>.

## Definitions

- **Hilbert space**
- Two elements are **orthogonal** or **perpendicular**
- Bessel's inequality
- A mapping H->H' is **unitary**
- H and H' are **unitarily equivalent** or **unitarily isomorphic**
- **pre-Hilbert space**
- **n-th Fourier coefficient** of $f\in L^1([-\pi,\pi])$
- **Parallelogram law**
- **Hardy space H^2(D)**
-

## Properties

- $L^2(R^d)$, a collection of **square integrable functions** on R^d is Hilbert
- $L^2(R^d)$ is **separable**

# Ergodic

## Definitions
- **measure-preserving transformation**
    - $\tau(E) is measurable$
    -
- **measure-preserving isomorphism**
    - $\tau^{-1}$ exists and it is also a measure-preserving transformation
